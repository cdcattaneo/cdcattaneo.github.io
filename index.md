My name is Christian Demierre Cattaneo. I'm Swiss, Italian, American, and French Canadian. I secretly hold 4 passports——do NOT tell anyone! I speak French fluently, Italian poorly, and a pitiful, incomprehensible version of Mandarin Chinese.

I grew up in Boston's Little Italy or [North End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_End,_Boston) and attended [Boston College High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College_High_School) in Dorchester, Mass.

My main interests are fintech, social media, and design. As a result I’ve begun building [hype](https://gethype.webflow.io/), a social media investing app. This is to serve my selfish desire to profit off of rising artists, athletes, and influencers using micro-investments instead of likes.

I studied Computer Engineering and Computer Science at [Northeastern University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University), where I started the Bodybuilding Club. You can check out my natural bodybuilding [here](https://www.instagram.com/zorbbrah/).

I also enjoy building websites in my spare time, like this one for a [Biomedical company](https://www.ais-imaging.com/).

Thanks for reading! :)
