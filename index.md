I'm from Boston's North End. I studied Computer Science at [Northeastern University](https://huntnewsnu.com/74975/campus/northeastern-undergraduate-applications-surge-breaking-record-2024/#:~:text=According%20to%20NGN%2C%20the%20number,is%20also%20expected%20to%20drop.) and am passionate about building beautiful websites.

Iâ€™ve spent the last few years [lifting](https://www.instagram.com/zorbbrah/) and [building](https://gethype.webflow.io/) a social media investing app. You can find my writing [here](https://www.instagram.com/zorbaesthetics).
