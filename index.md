My name is Christian Demierre Cattaneo. I'm Swiss, Italian, American, and Québécois. I speak French fluently, Italian poorly, and a pitiful, incomprehensible dialetec of tourist Mandarin. I grew up in Boston's historic [North End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_End,_Boston) and attended [Boston College High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College_High_School).

My main interests are fintech, social media, and design. As a result I’ve begun building [hype](https://gethype.webflow.io/), a social media investing app. This is to fulfill my selfish desire to profit off of rising artists, athletes, and influencers through micro-investments.

I studied Computer Engineering and Computer Science at [Northeastern](https://huntnewsnu.com/74975/campus/northeastern-undergraduate-applications-surge-breaking-record-2024/#:~:text=According%20to%20NGN%2C%20the%20number,is%20also%20expected%20to%20drop.), where I started the Bodybuilding Club. You can check out my bodybuilding [here](https://www.instagram.com/zorbbrah/).

I also enjoy building websites in my spare time, like this one [Biomedical Industry](https://www.ais-imaging.com/).
