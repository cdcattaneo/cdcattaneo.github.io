My name is Christian Demierre Cattaneo. I'm Swiss, Italian, Dutch, Canadian, and American. I grew up in Boston's historic [North End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_End,_Boston).

My main interests are cryptocurrency, social media, and design. As a result Iâ€™ve begun building [hype](https://gethype.webflow.io/), a social media investing app. The idea is to be able to invest in up-and-coming artists, athletes, and influencers through microtransactions.

I studied Computer Engineering and Computer Science at [Northeastern](https://huntnewsnu.com/74975/campus/northeastern-undergraduate-applications-surge-breaking-record-2024/#:~:text=According%20to%20NGN%2C%20the%20number,is%20also%20expected%20to%20drop.), where I started the Bodybuilding Club. You can check out my bodybuilding [here](https://www.instagram.com/zorbbrah/).

I also enjoy building websites in my spare time:
1. I made these shirt's for my Bodybuilding Club friends and I to wear as jokes to the gym: [Ironic T-Shirts](https://vril.shop/)
2. Here is a contracting job I did for a liquor store on Mass Ave: [Fine Wines & Spirits](https://deec90-17.myshopify.com/)
3. I built this for a biomedical startup applying for a government grant: [Biomedical Industry](https://www.ais-imaging.com/)
